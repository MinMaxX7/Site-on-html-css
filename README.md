# Site-on-html-css
This site with 5 pages is made simply on html / css, without any frameworks
I'm a little confused in github and don't know how to transfer or create folders here. If I cannot solve this problem, 
then in the HTML code you need to change the path or add folders, for example, those specified in the code.
I'm just learning, if that)
